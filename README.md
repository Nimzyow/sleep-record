Frontend

Since next js is being considered I wanted to build the frontend with Next js since I have experience with Next js.

Backend

I was considering using Django with Python as that would allow me to quickly build a backend with an opionated framework. However, after considering the role itself and how it is Node.js + TypeScript heavy, I wanted to demonstrate my ability with TypeScript. For the ORM I have chosen Prisma as my previous experiements with this ORM proved to be fruitful. I also decided to utilise GraphQL as the API layer due to the excellent developer experience and the ability to create types from the GraphQL schema which the frontend can take advantage of.

 Using Next js with TypeScript along with a Node js backend with TypeScript and a type safe ORM will allow for full synchronisation of types throughout the entire stack. This will result in reduced bugs and embaressing crashes/errors during runtime due to TypeScripts excellent type checking.
